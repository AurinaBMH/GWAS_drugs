### Data
`eQTL_protein_names.csv` contains protein nodes for the entire PPI network.

`eQTL_edges.csv` contains all interactions formed by the nodes. For a given interaction, i code whether the nodes are from first degree partner of disease genes (binary with 1 denoting first degree partner, 0 for disease gene), and which disease is the disease gene from.

`eQTL_identifier.csv` contains which disease is the protein from, the association type (LD or GWAS relationship) with the disease, whether it is a first degree interaction partner or not.
